                    Penny Peasgood, manager of the Yogan Shop says:
                    “The idea of our family business sprung from our conviction of the many health benefits of eating vegan.
                     I have struggled with my weight all my life and tried all sorts of diets with no long-term success. <br>
                     However, after a few months of vegan food, all those extra pounds had just melted.  
                     Also, I used to suffer from chronic fatigue but suddenly, 
                     I started to burst with energy. Needless to say, that I was delighted. 
                   <br> At first, my family thought I was being fussy as we all had been meat-eaters before. 
                   Seeing my elevated mood and betterment, my mum followed in my footsteps and her type-2 diabetes 
                   was a thing of the past within two years. <br>My dad took a bit more time to give it a go but he has
                    not regretted it! His arthritis got so much better that he enjoys playing football again."<br>
                    There are many scientifically proven health benefits of this lifestyle and we invite you to look into these. Read more…
